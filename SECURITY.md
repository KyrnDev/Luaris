# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Luaris is currently pre-release.

All alpha/beta versions are unsupported from a formal security support perspective. Security advisories will be addressed as soon as possible, but there are no guarantees on timelines or fixes before `1.0.0`.

Proper supported security handling begins from `1.x` releases.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.x     | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, report it privately by email:

- `danny@kyrn.dev`

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any proof-of-concept details (if available)

### What to expect

- You should receive an acknowledgement as soon as possible.
- During pre-`1.0.0`, fixes are best-effort with no guaranteed SLA.
- Accepted issues will be patched as soon as reasonably possible.
- If a report is declined, a short rationale will be provided where possible.
